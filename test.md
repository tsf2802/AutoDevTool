# Project Documentation: myproject

This documentation provides an overview of the `myproject` Django project structure and key components. It aims to help developers understand the codebase and facilitate future development and expansion.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Django project layout:

```
myproject/
├── myproject/           # Project container
│   ├── __init__.py    # Marks the directory as a Python package.  Usually empty.
│   ├── asgi.py        # ASGI configuration for asynchronous web servers.
│   ├── settings.py    # Django project settings.
│   ├── urls.py        # URL routing configuration.
│   └── wsgi.py        # WSGI configuration for web servers.
└── manage.py          # Django management script.
```

## Key Components

### 1. `myproject/settings.py`

This file contains all the configuration settings for the Django project. It's a crucial file for customizing the behavior of your application.

**Key Areas:**

- **`BASE_DIR`**: The root directory of your project. Used as the basis for other path configurations.
- **`SECRET_KEY`**: A secret key used for security purposes. **Important:** Keep this secret in production environments. Use environment variables for a secure deployment.
- **`DEBUG`**: A boolean indicating whether the project is in debug mode. Set to `False` in production.
- **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`**: A list of hostnames that the Django project is allowed to serve. Crucial for security.
- **`INSTALLED_APPS`**: A list of all Django applications used in the project. This includes built-in apps like `django.contrib.admin`, `django.contrib.auth`, etc., as well as any custom apps you create. To add applications, add them here.
- **`MIDDLEWARE`**: A list of middleware classes that process requests and responses. The order is significant. Add custom middleware here.
- **`ROOT_URLCONF`**: The root URL configuration module.
- **`TEMPLATES`**: Configuration for Django's template engine. You can customize template directories and context processors here.
- **`DATABASES`**: Configuration for the database connection. The default uses SQLite, but you can configure other database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). This is where you would configure connection details like host, port, username and passwords.
- **`AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`**: Settings for password validation.
- **`LANGUAGE_CODE`**: The default language code for the project.
- **`TIME_ZONE`**: The default time zone for the project.
- **`STATIC_URL`**: The URL for serving static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).

**Expanding the `settings.py`:**

- **Add custom settings:** You can define your own settings variables in this file for your application's specific needs.
- **Use environment variables:** For sensitive information like database passwords and API keys, it's best practice to use environment variables and access them using `os.environ.get('VARIABLE_NAME')`.
- **Configure logging:** Add logging configuration to handle errors and debugging.
- **Configure Email:** Set up settings for sending emails (e.g. using SMTP server).
- **Configure sessions:** Customize session management (e.g., using database-backed sessions).

### 2. `myproject/urls.py`

This file defines the URL patterns for the entire Django project. It maps URLs to specific views.

**Key Components:**

- **`urlpatterns`**: A list of `path()` objects, each defining a URL pattern.

**Expanding the `urls.py`:**

- **Include app-level URL configurations:** For each Django app in your project, create a `urls.py` file within the app. Then, use `include()` in the main `urls.py` to include the app's URLs:

  ```python
  from django.urls import include, path

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Example: Include URLs from 'myapp' app
  ]
  ```

- **Define URL patterns:** Use the `path()` function to map URLs to views:

  ```python
  from django.urls import path
  from . import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('', views.home, name='home'),  # Maps the root URL to the 'home' view
      path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
  ]
  ```

### 3. `myproject/wsgi.py` and `myproject/asgi.py`

These files provide the WSGI and ASGI configurations, respectively, for deploying the Django project to a web server.

- **`wsgi.py`**: Used for synchronous web servers.
- **`asgi.py`**: Used for asynchronous web servers.

Generally, you won't need to modify these files unless you have specific deployment requirements.

### 4. `manage.py`

This is a command-line utility for interacting with your Django project.

**Common Uses:**

- `python manage.py runserver`: Starts the development server.
- `python manage.py migrate`: Applies database migrations.
- `python manage.py createsuperuser`: Creates an administrative user.
- `python manage.py startapp <app_name>`: Creates a new Django app.
- `python manage.py shell`: Opens a Python interactive shell with Django environment loaded.

## Creating and Adding New applications

You can add new applications to your project using the command `python manage.py startapp <app_name>`.

After creating an app, you must add the app name to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your `settings.py` file.
